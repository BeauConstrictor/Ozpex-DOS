WELCOME TO OZPEX DOS
--------------------

Welcome to Ozpex DOS, the game-changing operating system for the Ozpex 64
computer.

GETTING STARTED

NOTE: Commands are written in uppercase for clarity, but should be entered in
lowercase

You have already managed to open the help disk, so you should be famililar with
the commands DSK, LST and CAT. To see a list of all the commands, use HLP.

When you power on the computer, you start with the T> drive active. This drive
is stored in memory. The contents of this disk are wiped when you power down the
computer, but this means you do not need a disk to try out the system.

To make your system useful, you can attach a storage volume. This is how Ozpex
DOS utilises the cartridge slots on the Ozpex 64. To do this, create a new bbram
and put it in cartridge slot 1. Now, you can type FMT A to format drive A (the
drive in slot 1) with an Ozpex DOS filesystem. This filesystem format is known
as OZDOS-FS.
