WELCOME TO OZPEX DOS
--------------------

Thank you for trying Ozpex DOS, the first (and only) operating system for the
Ozpex 64 computer.

Ozpex DOS is useful because it provides a filesystem, so a single cartridge can
contain all the programs you use, as well as the documents that you have created
with those programs.

GETTING STARTED

NOTE: Commands are written in uppercase for clarity, but should be entered in
lowercase on the system.

You have already managed to open the help disk, so you should be famililar with
the commands DSK, LST and CAT. To see a list of all the commands, use HLP.

When you power on the computer, you start with the T> drive active. This drive
is stored in memory. The contents of this disk are wiped when you power down the
computer, but this means you do not need a disk to try out the system.

To make your system useful, you can attach a storage volume. This is how Ozpex
DOS utilises the cartridge slots on the Ozpex 64. To do this, create a new BBRAM
and put it in cartridge slot 1. Now, you can type FMT A to format drive A (the
drive in slot 1) with an Ozpex DOS filesystem. This filesystem format is known
as OZDOS-FS. See technical.txt for more details on this format if you are
curious.

Now, you can type DSK A type change the active drive to A. Currently, this disk
is be blank, so lets change that. In the next release of Ozpex DOS, there will
be a command called EDT that will let you create a new text file and edit it.
