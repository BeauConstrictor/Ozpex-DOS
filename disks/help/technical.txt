TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

For those of you that are curious, this document outlines some technical details
about the implementation of Ozpex DOS that you may find interesting.

FILESYSTEM

Ozpex DOS uses a custom flat filesystem called OZDOS-FS, designed for 8K random
access storage. It has no directories and supports up to 29 files.

| STRUCTURE

- 32 sectors total, each 256 bytes.
- Sectors 0-1: File entries (directory).
- Sector 2: Usage map + filesystem signature.
- Sectors 3-31: Data sectors (file contents).

| SECTORS 0 & 1

Each file entry = 16 bytes:

- 12 B: Filename (space-padded)
- 3  B: Extension
- 1  B: Starting sector (0 - 31)

Unused entries are 16 bytes of `0x00`.  
The sector can fit 32 entries, but only 29 files can exist (as there are only
29 data sectors).

| SECTOR 2

- Bytes 0-31: Sector usage flags (`0xFF` = used, `0x00` = free).
- First 3 bytes always `0xFF` (reserved sectors).
- Bytes 252-255: Signature `DE AD BE EF` (filesystem validation).

| DATA SECTORS 3 -> 31

- 255 B: File data.
- 1 B: Link byte (next sector + end flag).
  - Bits 0-4: Next sector index.
  - Bit 7: End-of-file flag (1 = last sector).

| LIMITATIONS

- Flat filesystem (no directories)
- Fixed 8K drive size
- Max 29 files total
- Max file size: 7,395 bytes (255*29)
- 12-char filenames, 3-char extensions
- Poor performance on fragmentable media

| PERFORMING COMMON OPERATIONS

> NEW FILE

1. Find first free sector in sector 2.
2. Write data; mark sector as used.
3. Link additional sectors if needed.
4. Create file entry in sector 0 or 1.

> DELETING

1. Find file's first sector from entry.
2. Traverse sector chain using link bytes.
3. Mark all used sectors as free in sector 2.
4. Null out the file entry.

> READING

1. Find starting sector from entry.
2. Read data sequentially, following link bytes.
3. Stop when end flag (0x80) is set.

> RENAMING

1. Locate entry in sectors 0 or 1.
2. Overwrite filename and/or extension bytes.

> COMPOUND OPERATIONS

You can achieve other operations such as copying, overwriting and moving files
between disks by combining these operations.
