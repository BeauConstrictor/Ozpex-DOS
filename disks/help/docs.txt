SYSTEM CALLS

To interact with the filesystem, run commands from within programs, etc.,
programs make use of system calls. These are basically subroutines that are
designed to be used by external programs. Because the actual location of these
of these subroutines may vary between versions, and consistent reference table
exists starting at $FF00. For instance, to call the read_file subroutine, you
can do a 'JSR $FF09'. This address will always work as new syscalls will simply
be added to the end of the table, and none will ever be removed or recieve
breaking changes.

Paste this into your assembly code to get a reference to all the system calls:

; filesystem
read_file       = $ff00
check_eof       = $ff03
inc_addr        = $ff06
; command line
run_command     = $ff09
; outut
print           = $ff0c
print_byte      = $ff0f
; input (if these fail, program exits)
get_line        = $ff12
expect_filename = $ff15
expect_key      = $ff18
expect_byte     = $ff1b
